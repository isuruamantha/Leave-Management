## Leave management app

**Disclaimer** : I've created this application just for fun. Anybody can use this. But please give appropriate credits to libraries which are used in this application. 

### Instructions to setup App

Build and run the application as a normal android app. Please let me know if there are any issues. 

### Instructions to setup the Back-End
Backend of the application is written using PHP + MySQL. All the codes are available under Backend folder. 
- First need to setup the database. You can find the database schema in **Backend/leavemanagementsystem (1).sql**. Then import it in to your database. I've used PHPMyAdmin. 
- Then copy the **Backend/LeaveManagement** folder into your server. I've used Xampp in my local machine. 
- Then modify the DBconnection class by giving your credentials to the database. File can be found under **Backend/LeaveManagement/DBConnection.php **

Then you're good to go. Happy coding :)
